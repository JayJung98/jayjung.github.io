# [Story of PD] How to adapt new meta

As times goes by, new technologies are rapidly emerging. As a software engineer, I have to study and adapt to new technologies.
After watching this video, I realized that I needed to know how to use the new technology efficiently. I also have to find what I'm good at to take advantage of new technologies.

The video is about one of the successful TV program producers in Korea. He knows that if he repeats the same type of the program, the viewers will drift away, and then the program will lose more and more power. He repeated his best form of tv shows, but added new ideas little by little, providing viewers with new experiences. As a result, the programs he produced became successful, and this experience gave me a new idea. By adding 20 percent of new things from what he's good at, he made new changes, which led to success. I need to know what I'm good at, and find what I want to do and develop my career. Currently, I don't know what I'm good at. But I know what I want to do. I should continue to study data science (data visualization, machine learning, deep learning) or web development. It should also be clear where I am good at.
Moreover, the PD said, with the emergence of new Over-the-top media service (OTT) platforms such as YouTube and Netflix, when people started not watching TV, he began to use the OTTs. We need the ability to utilize new technologies.
I also wondered if chatGPT would appear and developers would disappear, but I should study how to use chatGPT in the good way and make a better project using artificial intelligence with my ideas.
