# How to adapt new meta

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lsEda2y4wWo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br>


&nbspAs a software engineer, it's important to constantly learn and adapt to new technologies. I recently watched a video about a successful TV program producer in Korea who recognized the importance of introducing new ideas and experiences to keep viewers engaged, rather than repeating the same type of shows which would cause them to lose interest. The producer also realized that the ever-decreasing ratings were due to the development of new technologies such as OTT platforms like YouTube and Netflix, and found ways to use these technologies to his advantage. This taught me the importance of identifying what I'm good at and finding ways to incorporate new technologies to drive success in my career. <br>

&nbspTo start, I need to identify my strengths and set goals to constantly develop my skills in my field. While I am currently studying web development or data science, I should always keep an open mind and be willing to explore other areas as well. It's also important to not be afraid of new technologies, but instead find ways to incorporate them into my work. For example, the advent of ChatGPT has sparked discussions among developers about its potential to improve projects by identifying errors in coding. I can use this tool to not only find errors, but also to enhance my ideas and create more complete projects. By adding just 20 percent of new things to what I'm already good at, I can make significant changes that lead to success.
